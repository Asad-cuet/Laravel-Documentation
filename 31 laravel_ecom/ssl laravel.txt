Instructions:
Step 1: Download and extract the library files.


Step 2: Copy the Library folder and put it in the laravel project's app/ directory. 
If needed, then run composer dump -o.


Step 3: Copy the config/sslcommerz.php file into your project's config/ folder.


Now, we have already copied the core library files. Let's do copy some other 
helpers files that is provided to understand the integration process. 
The other files are not related to core library.


Optional: If you later encounter issues with session destroying after redirect, you can 
set 'same_site' => null, in your config/session.php file.


Step 4: Add STORE_ID and STORE_PASSWORD values on your project's .env file.
 You can register for a store at https://developer.sslcommerz.com/registration/


Step 5: Copy the SslCommerzPaymentController into your project's Controllers folder.


Step 6: Copy the defined routes from routes/web.php into your project's route file.


Step 7: Add the below routes into the $excepts array of VerifyCsrfToken middleware.

protected $except = [
    '/pay-via-ajax', '/success','/cancel','/fail','/ipn'
];


Step 8: Copy the resources/views/*.blade.php files 
into your project's resources/views/ folder.
Now, let's go to the main integration part.



Step 9: To integrate popup checkout, use the below script before the end of body tag.

For Sandbox

<script>
    (function (window, document) {
        var loader = function () {
            var script = document.createElement("script"), tag = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];
            script.src = "https://sandbox.sslcommerz.com/embed.min.js?" + Math.random().toString(36).substring(7);
            tag.parentNode.insertBefore(script, tag);
        };

        window.addEventListener ? window.addEventListener("load", loader, false) : window.attachEvent("onload", loader);
    })(window, document);
</script>


For Live



<script>
    (function (window, document) {
        var loader = function () {
            var script = document.createElement("script"), tag = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];
            script.src = "https://seamless-epay.sslcommerz.com/embed.min.js?" + Math.random().toString(36).substring(7);
            tag.parentNode.insertBefore(script, tag);
        };
    
        window.addEventListener ? window.addEventListener("load", loader, false) : window.attachEvent("onload", loader);
    })(window, document);
</script>



Step 10: Use the below button where you want to show the "Pay Now" button:
<button class="your-button-class" id="sslczPayBtn"
        token="if you have any token validation"
        postdata="your javascript arrays or objects which requires in backend"
        order="If you already have the transaction generated for current order"
        endpoint="/pay-via-ajax"> Pay Now
</button>



Step 11: For EasyCheckout (Popup) integration, you can update the checkout_ajax.
php or use a different file according to your need. We have provided a basic sample page

Step 12: For Hosted Checkout integration, you can update the checkout_hosted.
php or use a different file according to your need. We have provided a basic sample page 
from where you can kickstart the payment gateway integration.


Step 13: For redirecting action from SSLCommerz Payment gateway, we have also 
provided sample success.php, cancel.php, fail.phpfiles. You can update those
 files according to your need.

'secure' => true,
'same_site' => 'none',
